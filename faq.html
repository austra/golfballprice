            <h2>Where do these prices come from?</h2>
            <p>We use Amazon's Product Advertising API to retrieve product information.</p>

            <h2>Why doesn't this product appear on your site?</h2>
            <p>We aggressively filter our product list to remove duplicates, fake products, spam, and out of stock listings. This results in the removal of approximately 1.9% of all listings.</p>
            <p>In some cases, our algorithms cannot correctly classify products into a known category, so they may be unintentionally excluded. The list of unclassifiable products is reviewed by a human editor semi-regularly.</p>

            <h2>Why shouldn't I buy the cheapest golf ball?</h2>
            <p>You shouldn't buy the cheapest golf ball because they often lack quality construction and may not provide the performance or durability needed for consistent play, as highlighted by experts at Golf.com and Golf Monthly.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What about shipping?</h2>
            <p>The prices listed here don't include shipping and taxes, as we don't know where you live. The majority of these listings include free shipping, especially if you have Amazon Prime but make sure to check shipping costs before placing an order.</p>
